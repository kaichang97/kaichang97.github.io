      <description>Project Scope Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has real-time Twitter and flights datasets available. We decided to explore the possibility of correlation between the number of successfully landed commercial flights and overall Twitter activity. Assuming this hypothesis is proven, our team would have recommended Twitter to make a joint program with airlines using the hashtag #landedsafelywith[name_of_the_airline_company] to promote flights for specific airlines. As a result, this would create a mutually beneficial relationship between Twitter and the associated airline companies.</description>
